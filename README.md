### 1. Introduction

Bug bounty hunting is the process of discovering security vulnerabilities in applications, websites, and systems and reporting them responsibly to earn rewards.

##### Key Components of Bug Bounty Programs:

1. **Scope**: Specifies the assets (websites, APIs, apps) in-scope and out-of-scope.
2. **Submission Guidelines**: Includes requirements for PoC (Proof of Concept).
3. **Reward Structure**: Based on severity (low, medium, high, critical).

Popular Platforms:

- [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com)
- [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com)
- [Intigriti](https://www.intigriti.com)
- [Synack Red Team](https://www.synack.com/red-team/)
