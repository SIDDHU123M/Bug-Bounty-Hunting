## 1. Introduction

Bug bounty hunting is the process of discovering security vulnerabilities in applications, websites, and systems and reporting them responsibly to earn rewards.  

### Key Components of Bug Bounty Programs:
1. **Scope**: Specifies the assets (websites, APIs, apps) in-scope and out-of-scope.  
2. **Submission Guidelines**: Includes requirements for PoC (Proof of Concept).  
3. **Reward Structure**: Based on severity (low, medium, high, critical).  

Popular Platforms:  
- [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com)  
- [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com)  
- [Intigriti](https://www.intigriti.com)  
- [Synack Red Team](https://www.synack.com/red-team/)

## 2. Why Choose Bug Bounty Hunting?

- **Skill Development**: Improve your web, network, and mobile security knowledge.  
- **Financial Opportunities**: High-paying rewards for critical vulnerabilities.  
- **Flexibility**: Work independently and at your own pace.  
- **Community Recognition**: Build credibility in the cybersecurity industry.

## 3. Beginner Stage

### Prerequisites:
- **Basic Networking**: Understand TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS.  
- **Programming Knowledge**: Familiarity with Python, JavaScript, and Bash.  
- **Understanding Web Architecture**: Client-server model, session management, cookies.  
- **Browser DevTools**: Inspect elements, track network requests, debug JavaScript.  

### Concepts to Learn:
1. **OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities**:
   - Injection (SQL, NoSQL, Command).

   - Security Misconfigurations.
   - Insecure Deserialization.
2. **HTTP Basics**:
   - HTTP Methods (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT).  
   - Status Codes (200, 301, 403, 404, 500).  
   - Headers (Authorization, Cookies, Content-Type).  
3. **Web Authentication**:
   - Cookies vs. Tokens.  
   - OAuth and SSO flows.
