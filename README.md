### **Complete Roadmap to Mastering Bug Bounty Hunting**

---

#### **1. Introduction**

- **What is Bug Bounty Hunting?**  
  Bug bounty hunting is the process of identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities in applications, websites, or networks to earn rewards or recognition. Organizations launch bug bounty programs to crowdsource security testing and improve their defenses.

- **How It Works:**  
  - Researchers sign up on platforms hosting bug bounty programs.
  - Study the program's scope, rules, and targets.
  - Identify, validate, and responsibly report vulnerabilities.
  - Earn rewards based on severity and impact.

- **Significance:**  
  Bug bounty programs enhance security while providing ethical hackers with opportunities to test and refine their skills.

- **Popular Platforms:**  
  - **HackerOne**: Global platform with a vast range of bounty programs.
  - **Bugcrowd**: Known for structured and beginner-friendly programs.
  - **Open Bug Bounty**: Free platform focusing on web application security.
