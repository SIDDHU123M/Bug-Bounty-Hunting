### 1. Introduction

**What is Bug Bounty Hunting?**  
Bug bounty hunting is an opportunity to uncover and responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities in exchange for recognition, monetary rewards, or both. It fosters ethical hacking practices and strengthens application defenses.

**How Bug Bounty Programs Work:**  
- Organizations define a scope, including in-scope and out-of-scope assets.  
- Researchers identify and responsibly report valid vulnerabilities.  
- Rewards are issued based on severity, impact, and program policies.

**Significance:**  
- Protects sensitive data and infrastructure.  
- Encourages skill-building and financial opportunities for ethical hackers.

**Popular Platforms:**  
- **HackerOne**: Well-structured platform for beginners and professionals.  
- **Bugcrowd**: Beginner-friendly with a variety of programs.  
- **Intigriti**: Offers a hybrid model of bug bounties and pentesting.
